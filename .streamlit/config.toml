[theme]
# Theme block removed to allow Streamlit's Settings > "Choose app theme" to operate.
# If you prefer a default app theme, re-add a minimal theme block here (or use the
# Settings modal in the Streamlit app). Currently left intentionally minimal so
# users can pick Light/Dark/System from the Streamlit Settings menu.
